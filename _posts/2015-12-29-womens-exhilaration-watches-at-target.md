Women's Xhilaration Watches at Target

I have been craving a watch for a while now. With the invention of the smartphone, it seems as if they all but disappeared. People still wore them, but not hardly as much, since we could quickly check the time (in digital form, for all of us lazy peeps) on our phones. But they have definitely made a comeback as a stylish and must have accessory, and I knew I needed to get my hands on a new one. 

My priority was finding one with a rose gold face. Last week, right before Christmas, Target's Carousel app featured a 25% off watches - chaching! This was my golden opportunity to get a new watch at my favorite store. 

The selection was slim since it was less than 48 hours until the big day, but I walked away with these two beauties: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/780cbd86-f7e1-4c7b-88ca-20151f79e959.png)

I could NOT resist this one. The rose gold with the pink dip dye face?! I could have lived with a different color for the wristband, but that I still love grey and that was an easy compromise. This was definitely coming home with me. 

This next one was a bonus - while not planning on buying two, I saw this one and couldn't resist either. It's classic and fashionable. The rubber band isn't always the most comfortable, but I still like it.
